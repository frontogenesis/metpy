<descript>
<abstract>This GIS data set represents the state bounds of Florida, including both land and water areas. The offshore boundary was acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Submerged Lands Act shapefile. The state borders between Florida and Georgia and Florida and Alabama were digitized by FWRI staff using Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) maps.</abstract>
<purpose>This data set was developed to represent the state bounds of Florida including land and water area. The boundaries are based on information available and should not be construed as legally binding.</purpose>
<supplinf>Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.</supplinf>

<complete>These data are complete for the state of Florida. DRG files were not available offshore, so the Florida boundary arcs were extended to the Submerged Lands Act boundary to form a complete polygon.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>Positional accuracy of the offshore line is based on source data that is assumed to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. Accuracy of the line between Florida and other states is based on DRG's which meet National Map Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000 scale maps. Accuracy of the extension of the gap between the state line depicted on DRG's and the Submerged Lands Act line is unknown.</horizpar>

<procstep>
<procdesc>The Submerged Lands Act shapefile was acquired from NOAA's Legislative Atlas Web site. This file was originally in polygon format. The shapefile was converted to coverage and the offshore arcs near Florida were extracted. These Arcs were reprojected to Florida Albers. The borders between Florida and Georgia and Florida and Alabama were digitized using DRG files as a base. These arcs were extended to meet the offshore arcs and leftover dangles were removed. Polygon topology was built and the layer was loaded to ArcSDE</procdesc>
